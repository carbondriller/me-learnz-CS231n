# [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu)

My solutions to this computer vision course taught at Stanford University (spring 2017).
I am not a student of SU, I just do this out of curiosity and to help me in my current job.

## Credits

* [lightaime's solutions](https://github.com/lightaime/cs231n): I used these to verify my solutions and pull me out when stuck
* [cthoreys's solutions](https://github.com/cthorey/CS231): dtto, Also used his batch normalization implementation

## Notes

* I'm using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) Python distribution (3.6).
* To run the assignments notebooks I use `jupyter notebook`.
* Manually resolved errors (xrange, ...) and installed missing packages by `conda install ...`
* I didn't mess with virtualenvs and requitements.txt since it was broken when I tried it.
